          Brands are, above all, the people behind them. Successful branding
          means creating value through connecting with people on an emotional
          level, making businesses more personal. This requires innovative
          thinking which relates not only to aesthetic decisions, but activating
          the hearts and minds of your audience.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I work alongside artists and business to create unique identity
          design, including logo design, custom typography and illustration.
          This can be translated in limitless ways, but most often through
          packaging design, business cards, signage, publication, and online
          platforms. Find out more about the services I offer below.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Custom Typography</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Typography is the primary tool to showcase your brands personality. As
          we examine the future of engaging, powerful and relevant branding, we
          can see typography being harnessed in unique and innovative ways.
          Successful branding utilises custom and bespoke typography to
          articulate a narrative which is distinctive, intentional, and uniquely
          their own.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Consider the phrase ‘it’s not what you say but how you say it’. In the
          world of communication design this couldn’t be more true. Typography
          is your brand’s superpower. It will elevate any concept, project or
          business with the ability to speak for itself without the need to be
          explained by words.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Logo Design</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Perhaps the most influential component of logo design is it’s ability
          to cultivate loyalty. When people begin to associate your logo with
          certain ideas, memories and emotions, your brand will have
          successfully set themselves apart and established an ongoing
          relationship with their consumer. As the foundation of your brand’s
          identity, your logo will promote trust, familiarity and recognition
          within your industry.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Setting the stage for the elements which make up your identity such as
          colours, tones and typography, your logo communicates an instant
          language which articulates your values, connects you to your community
          and asserts the quality of your business. Successful logo design will
          establish a marketable identity, a consistent brand experience and a
          convincing brand personality.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Illustration</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Illustration has the ability to enrich a brands visual language and
          unfold a brand’s story beyond a preliminary brand mark. Whether it is
          used as a central part of your logo design or as an extension of your
          identity, illustrative elements help to reinforce the personality of
          your brand, and can be as distinctive to your design as the logo
          itself. Including illustration in your branding project will also
          broaden the possibilities of design choices when considering expanding
          your identity across other printed and digital media such as
          packaging, signage, websites and social media.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Businesses of all sizes can benefit greatly from the use of
          illustration, and it’s knack for simplifying complex concepts and
          enhancing key qualities and quirks of your brand’s identity, like
          playfulness, elegance or nostalgia.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Branding Manual</u></h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Consistency is everything when it comes to meaningful and memorable
          branding. A branding manual is an additional resource which will
          assist you in carrying out your branding successfully and consistently
          across all of your platforms. This will incorporate all of the new
          ingredients that make up your identity design, and act as a recipe for
          how to use them.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Elements included can vary between jobs, but typically incorporate
          your brand’s colour palette, fonts, imagery, tone of voice and
          messaging, as well as how your brand uses language and emotion to
          translate their identity. This will assist your brand in remaining
          recognisable, familiar and reliable in the eyes of your target
          audience, and ensure that you don’t confuse your consumers with an
          inconsistent narrative.
