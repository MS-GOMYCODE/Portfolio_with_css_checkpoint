          Ellie is a freelance graphic designer based in Hobart, Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Putting her inclination to daydream to good use, Ellie’s adoration of
          fantasy growing up blossomed into a love of identity design, where
          daydreaming could now become her superpower.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Her experience of branding as a means to be transported to new places
          inspired her to launch her own career as a designer in 2017, after
          graduating her bachelors degree in Fine Arts at the University of
          Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Ellie’s practice focuses on projects which explore communication
          design outside the scope of current trends and delve into the
          individual quirks and personalities of her clients, giving her work an
          original and authentic quality that sets her apart her from others in
          the industry.
